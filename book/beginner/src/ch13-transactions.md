# Chapter 13. Transactions and Data Access Patterns

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the importance of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) in database operations.
- Learn how `fluo` manages transaction context using `AsyncLocalStorage` (ALS).
- Implement manual transactions using the Prisma block pattern.
- Use the `PrismaTransactionInterceptor` for request-scoped transactions.
- Design transaction-agnostic repositories that work seamlessly inside and outside transactions.
- Refactor FluoBlog to handle complex operations like user registration with an initial profile setup.

## Prerequisites
- Completed Chapter 12 (Database Integration with Prisma).
- Familiarity with TypeScript async/await patterns.
- Basic understanding of database locks and isolation levels.

## 13.1 The Need for Atomic Operations

In the previous chapter, we connected FluoBlog to a database. That solved persistence, but it did not solve coordination between related writes.

Many business operations are not just a single "save". As soon as one request needs to create or update multiple records together, we need a rule for what happens when one step succeeds and another fails.

Consider a scenario where a new user signs up:
1. You create the `User` record.
2. You create an initial `Profile` record.
3. You send a welcome notification.

What happens if step 1 succeeds but step 2 fails? 

You end up with a "zombie" user who has no profile, potentially causing crashes in other parts of the system that expect profiles to exist.

This is where **Transactions** come in. A transaction ensures that a group of operations either all succeed or all fail together. This property is known as **Atomicity**, and it is what turns separate database calls into one dependable unit of work.

## 13.2 Fluo's Transaction Philosophy

Once we know why atomicity matters, the next question is how to preserve it without making the code harder to read. In many frameworks, managing transactions involves passing a "transaction object" or "database client" through every function call.

This is often called the "TX injection" pattern:

```typescript
// Legacy/Explicit pattern - HARD TO MAINTAIN
async createUser(data, tx?) {
  const client = tx || this.db;
  return client.user.create({ data });
}
```

This approach pollutes your business logic with database concerns and makes refactoring a nightmare.

`fluo` takes a different approach. It uses **AsyncLocalStorage (ALS)** to maintain a transaction context that travels through your asynchronous call stack automatically, so transaction handling stays in the infrastructure layer instead of leaking into every method signature.

### The Repository Rule

As we saw in the previous chapter, Fluo repositories always use `PrismaService.current()`.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersRepository {
  constructor(@Inject(PrismaService) private readonly prisma: PrismaService<any>) {}

  async create(data) {
    // current() automatically detects if we are in a transaction context!
    return this.prisma.current().user.create({ data });
  }
}
```

Because of this, your repository doesn't need to know if it's being called as part of a transaction or as a standalone operation.

## 13.3 Manual Transactions: The Block Pattern

With that philosophy in place, the most straightforward way to run a transaction in Fluo is using the Prisma transaction block.

```typescript
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@fluojs/core';
import { PrismaService } from '@fluojs/prisma';

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(PrismaService) private readonly prisma: PrismaService<any>,
    private readonly usersRepo: UsersRepository,
    private readonly profilesRepo: ProfilesRepository,
  ) {}

  async registerUser(userData, profileData) {
    // Operations inside this block are part of one transaction
    return this.prisma.transaction(async () => {
      const user = await this.usersRepo.create(userData);
      await this.profilesRepo.create({ ...profileData, userId: user.id });
      return user;
    });
  }
}
```

If `profilesRepo.create` throws an error, the entire transaction, including the user creation, is automatically rolled back by the database. That gives the service one clear success path instead of forcing later code to clean up half-finished state.

## 13.4 Request-Scoped Transactions with Interceptors

Sometimes, the transaction boundary should be larger than one method. If the whole HTTP request represents one unit of work, Fluo provides a built-in interceptor for that purpose.

### Using @UseInterceptors

```typescript
import { Controller, Post, UseInterceptors } from '@fluojs/core';
import { PrismaTransactionInterceptor } from '@fluojs/prisma';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Post()
  @UseInterceptors(PrismaTransactionInterceptor)
  async signup() {
    // Every database operation called within this request 
    // will be part of the same transaction.
  }
}
```

This is extremely powerful for simple CRUD APIs where you want to ensure total consistency without writing manual transaction blocks in your services. It is the same idea as the block pattern, just applied at the request boundary instead of inside one service method.

### When to use Interceptors vs Blocks?

- **Interceptors**: Use when the entire request lifecycle is a single unit of work. Good for standard REST resources.
- **Blocks**: Use when you need fine-grained control or when only a small part of a complex service method needs to be atomic.

## 13.5 Advanced Data Access Patterns

By this point, we have seen how transactions are created. The next design question is how to keep the data layer clean while using them consistently.

In FluoBlog, we want our data layer to be both clean and efficient.

### The Service-Repository Split

- **Repository**: Handles "How" we talk to the database (queries, joins, filters).
- **Service**: Handles "What" the business logic is (combining repositories, handling transactions, business rules).

### Isolation Levels

While Fluo handles the "when" of transactions, sometimes you need to control the "how" regarding concurrency. 

Prisma allows you to set isolation levels within the `transaction` call:

```typescript
await this.prisma.transaction(async () => {
  // ...
}, {
  isolationLevel: 'Serializable', // Highest protection against race conditions
});
```

## 13.6 FluoBlog: Implementation

That separation becomes clearer in a real example. Let's implement a robust post creation flow that also updates a "user post count" (for performance reasons).

```typescript
// src/posts/posts.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class PostsService {
  async createPost(userId: number, dto: CreatePostDto) {
    return this.prisma.transaction(async () => {
      const post = await this.postsRepo.create({ ...dto, authorId: userId });
      await this.usersRepo.incrementPostCount(userId);
      return post;
    });
  }
}
```

Even if the `incrementPostCount` fails, we won't have a new post without a corresponding count update. The database change remains coherent, and the service code still reads like one business action rather than a pile of defensive cleanup steps.

## 13.7 Summary

In this chapter, we explored the critical world of data integrity and the patterns that keep related writes coordinated.

We learned that:
- Transactions are essential for keeping our data consistent during complex operations.
- Fluo uses `AsyncLocalStorage` to make transactions transparent to your repositories.
- The `current()` method is the key to transaction-agnostic data access.
- Manual blocks offer precision, while interceptors offer convenience for request-scoped logic.
- A proper Service-Repository split keeps your codebase maintainable as it grows.

By completing Part 2, you have mastered the "Data" and "Configuration" aspects of Fluo. Across these three chapters, you moved from explicit configuration, to persistent storage, to transaction-safe data access, which is a big step from an in-memory toy to a robust database-backed application structure. In Part 3, we will shift our focus to security, starting with Authentication and JWT.
