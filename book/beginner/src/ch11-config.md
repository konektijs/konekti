# Chapter 11. Configuration Management

## Learning Objectives
- Understand why environment variables should be handled explicitly.
- Register `ConfigModule` and load configuration from `.env` files.
- Learn the precedence of configuration sources in `fluo`.
- Use `ConfigService` to inject configuration into providers.
- Implement configuration validation to prevent startup with invalid settings.
- Progress FluoBlog from hardcoded values to a configurable setup.

## Prerequisites
- Completed Chapter 10 (OpenAPI Automation).
- Basic understanding of environment variables (`process.env`).
- Familiarity with Fluo module registration.

## 11.1 The Need for Explicit Configuration

Hardcoding values like database URLs, API keys, or port numbers directly in your code is a recipe for disaster. Those values change as soon as you move between local development, staging, and production, so keeping them buried in source files quickly turns simple deployment differences into bugs.

Most Node.js developers are used to just reaching for `process.env`, and that works at first. The trouble is that direct ambient access makes your code harder to test and your dependencies harder to track because every part of the application can quietly depend on global state.

`fluo` encourages an **explicit** approach to configuration. By using the `@fluojs/config` package, you can centralize how your application discovers, merges, and validates its settings, which gives the rest of the chapter a clear direction: define the settings once, inject them where needed, and fail early when something important is missing.

### Why Explicit over Ambient?

Ambient configuration is like magic—it's just "there". 

Explicit configuration is like a contract—you define what you need, and the system ensures it's provided.

Benefits of the explicit approach include:

- **Predictability**: You know exactly where every setting comes from.
- **Validation**: You can fail fast if a required setting is missing.
- **Type Safety**: Access your configuration through a typed service.
- **Testability**: Easily mock configuration in unit tests.

## 11.2 Setting up ConfigModule

Once the need for explicit configuration is clear, the next step is to wire that policy into the application itself. To start managing configuration, we first need to install and register the `ConfigModule`.

```bash
pnpm add @fluojs/config
```

In FluoBlog, we will update our `AppModule` to include the configuration logic.

### Registration in AppModule

Open `src/app.module.ts` and add the `ConfigModule` to the imports array.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@fluojs/core';
import { ConfigModule } from '@fluojs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      envFile: '.env',
      defaults: {
        PORT: 3000,
        NODE_ENV: 'development',
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, we are telling `fluo` to:
1. Look for a `.env` file.
2. Provide some default values if nothing is found elsewhere.

### Understanding Precedence

`fluo` follows a strict precedence order when merging configuration sources:

1. **Runtime Overrides**: Values passed directly in the code (highest priority).
2. **Process Environment**: Values found in `process.env`.
3. **Environment File**: Values defined in your `.env` file.
4. **Defaults**: Hardcoded default values in your module setup (lowest priority).

This hierarchy allows you to define sensible defaults while still allowing environment-specific overrides in CI/CD or production. In practice, that means you can keep development friction low without losing control over what happens in real deployments.

## 11.3 Using ConfigService

Once registered, the configuration setup becomes something your application can depend on. Instead of reaching back into the module setup, you read values through the `ConfigService`, which keeps day-to-day application code focused on usage rather than loading details.

### Injecting the Service

Let's say we want to use the configured port in our bootstrap logic.

```typescript
import { FluoFactory } from '@fluojs/core';
import { ConfigService } from '@fluojs/config';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await FluoFactory.create(AppModule);
  
  const configService = app.get(ConfigService);
  const port = configService.get('PORT') || 3000;
  
  await app.listen(port);
  console.log(`Application is running on: http://localhost:${port}`);
}
bootstrap();
```

Inside a provider or controller, you use standard dependency injection:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@fluojs/core';
import { ConfigService } from '@fluojs/config';

@Injectable()
export class MyService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(ConfigService) private readonly config: ConfigService
  ) {}

  getDbUrl() {
    return this.config.get('DATABASE_URL');
  }
}
```

### get() vs getOrThrow()

The `ConfigService` provides two main ways to retrieve values:

- `get(key)`: Returns the value or `undefined` if not found.
- `getOrThrow(key)`: Returns the value or throws an Error if the key is missing.

Using `getOrThrow()` is highly recommended for critical settings like database credentials. It ensures that your application doesn't try to run in a "broken" state, and it sets up the next step naturally: validating those critical settings as early as possible.

## 11.4 Configuration Validation

A common source of production bugs is an application starting up with "partially valid" configuration. If one value is present and another is missing, the app may boot successfully and fail only after a real request touches the broken path.

`fluo` allows you to validate your configuration at bootstrap time, so the application can reject that half-configured state before it causes confusing runtime behavior.

### Using a Validation Schema

While `@fluojs/config` is unopinionated about the validation library, it integrates beautifully with standard patterns.

You can pass a validation function to `forRoot`.

```typescript
ConfigModule.forRoot({
  validate: (config) => {
    if (!config.DATABASE_URL) {
      throw new Error('DATABASE_URL is required');
    }
    return config;
  },
})
```

By validating during `forRoot`, you ensure that the application will **abort** if the environment is not set up correctly. This "fail-fast" behavior is essential for reliable deployments.

## 11.5 FluoBlog: Moving to Config

At this point, we have the pieces we need. FluoBlog still has a few hardcoded values, so this is where the chapter moves from configuration concepts to a concrete cleanup that the rest of the data-focused part can build on.

### Creating the .env File

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/fluoblog
JWT_SECRET=super-secret-key
```

### Updating FluoBlog Configuration

We will create a specific configuration loader to keep our `AppModule` clean.

```typescript
// src/config/configuration.ts
export default () => ({
  port: parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000', 10),
  database: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
});
```

Then in `app.module.ts`:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@fluojs/core';
import { ConfigModule } from '@fluojs/config';
import configuration from './config/configuration';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      load: [configuration],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This pattern allows you to group related settings into objects (e.g., `config.get('database.url')`), making the configuration structure much more intuitive as the project grows. More importantly for our next chapter, it gives the database layer one clear place to read connection details instead of scattering that responsibility across the app.

## 11.6 Summary

In this chapter, we transitioned from "magic" environment variables to a structured configuration system that the rest of the application can rely on.

We learned that:
- Explicit configuration is safer and more testable.
- `ConfigModule` centralizes the loading and merging of settings.
- `ConfigService` provides a typed, injectable interface for our application logic.
- Precedence rules ensure that production environments can override local defaults.
- Validation at startup prevents unstable application states.

By mastering configuration, you've taken a significant step toward making FluoBlog "production-ready". You now have a predictable way to load ports, secrets, and database settings before the app starts, which is exactly the foundation we need next. In the next chapter, we will use these configuration skills to connect FluoBlog to a real database using Prisma.
