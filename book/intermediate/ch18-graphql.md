# Chapter 18. GraphQL API

This chapter covers how to add a query layer to FluoShop that differs from REST. Through Chapter 17, we expanded notifications and realtime flows. Here, we'll use the product catalog as the center point for building a GraphQL API and execution guardrails.

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish the structural benefits of introducing GraphQL in fluo.
- Outline `GraphqlModule` configuration and code-first resolver registration.
- Configure a flow that reduces the N+1 problem with request-scoped DataLoader.
- Review SSE-based default subscriptions and optional WebSocket subscription configuration.
- Apply operational guardrails such as complexity limits and introspection control.
- Define when to connect GraphQL to the FluoShop product catalog.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Chapter 13, Chapter 14, Chapter 15, Chapter 16, and Chapter 17.
- Understanding of core GraphQL terms such as resolver, schema, and subscription.
- Operational experience designing API security and performance limits together.

## 18.1 Why GraphQL in fluo?

fluo's philosophy of **Explicit Over Implicit** fits well with GraphQL's typed schema model. Using `@fluojs/graphql` gives you these benefits.

- **Unified DI**: Resolvers are treated as top-level Providers inside the fluo container.
- **Protocol Portability**: The same GraphQL API can run on Node.js, Bun, Deno, and Edge Workers without code changes.
- **Standard Decorators**: It does not depend on the legacy `experimentalDecorators` flag.
- **Performance**: Direct integration with the runtime facade reduces unnecessary overhead.

## 18.2 Installation and Setup

First, install the required dependencies.

```bash
pnpm add @fluojs/graphql graphql graphql-yoga
```

The center of the integration is `GraphqlModule`. Unlike many fluo modules, `GraphqlModule` currently uses synchronous `forRoot` configuration.

## 18.3 Building Code-first Resolvers

Fluo uses a **code-first** approach where TypeScript classes become the basis for the GraphQL schema.

### Defining the Resolver

```typescript
import { Resolver, Query, Mutation, Arg } from '@fluojs/graphql';
import { Inject } from '@fluojs/core';
import { ProductService } from './product.service';

class ProductInput {
  @Arg('id')
  id = '';
}

@Inject(ProductService)
@Resolver()
export class ProductResolver {
  constructor(private readonly productService: ProductService) {}

  @Query({ input: ProductInput })
  async product(input: ProductInput) {
    return this.productService.findById(input.id);
  }

  @Query()
  async products() {
    return this.productService.findAll();
  }
}
```

`@Arg(...)` is a field decorator for resolver input DTOs. Mark the DTO fields you want to expose as GraphQL arguments, then pass that DTO class through the operation's `input` option.

### Registering the Module

```typescript
import { Module } from '@fluojs/core';
import { GraphqlModule } from '@fluojs/graphql';
import { ProductResolver } from './product.resolver';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphqlModule.forRoot({
      resolvers: [ProductResolver],
      graphiql: true, // Enable the IDE for development
    }),
  ],
  providers: [ProductResolver],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## 18.4 Solving N+1 with DataLoaders

The N+1 problem is the most common performance bottleneck in GraphQL. Fluo provides request-scoped **DataLoader** support so repeated lookups in the same request can be grouped into batches.

### Creating a DataLoader

```typescript
import { createDataLoader, type GraphQLContext } from '@fluojs/graphql';

const authorLoader = createDataLoader(async (ids: string[]) => {
  const authors = await authorService.findByIds(ids);
  // Ensure the returned array matches the order of the input IDs.
  return ids.map(id => authors.find(a => a.id === id));
});
```

### Using the Loader in a Supported Root Resolver

```typescript
class BookInput {
  @Arg('id')
  id = '';
}

@Resolver()
export class BookResolver {
  @Query({ input: BookInput })
  async book(input: BookInput, context: GraphQLContext) {
    const book = await bookService.findById(input.id);
    const author = await authorLoader(context).load(book.authorId);

    return {
      ...book,
      author,
    };
  }
}
```

`authorLoader(context)` returns a loader instance bound to a specific GraphQL execution context. Therefore, batching and caching are shared only within a single request. Keeping this scope prevents one user's lookup results from leaking into another request while still reducing the N+1 problem. At the moment, `@fluojs/graphql` documents DataLoader usage through root operations that explicitly receive `context: GraphQLContext`, rather than runtime field-resolver attachment.

## 18.5 Real-time with Subscriptions

Fluo supports GraphQL subscriptions based on **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** by default, and WebSocket can be enabled when needed.

### SSE Subscriptions (Default)

```typescript
import { Subscription } from '@fluojs/graphql';

@Resolver()
export class NotificationResolver {
  @Subscription()
  async onNewNotification() {
    return pubsub.subscribe('NEW_NOTIFICATION');
  }
}
```

### Enabling WebSockets

Enable the WebSocket transport when you need bidirectional realtime communication or when the client environment is WebSocket-centered. Check whether the default SSE path is enough first, then choose WebSockets only when bidirectional messaging is actually needed so the operational boundary stays simpler. The WebSocket transport requires an adapter that exposes a Node HTTP/S server with upgrade listeners, such as the Node HTTP adapter; runtimes without that server surface should keep the default SSE subscription path.

```typescript
GraphqlModule.forRoot({
  subscriptions: {
    websocket: {
      enabled: true,
      limits: {
        maxConnections: 100,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## 18.6 Operational Guardrails

GraphQL APIs can be vulnerable to deeply nested or expensive queries. Fluo includes **operational guardrails** in the default configuration to reduce these risks.

- **Introspection**: Disabled by default in production environments.
- **Complexity limits**: Use `maxDepth`, `maxComplexity`, and `maxCost` to reduce excessive query cost and the possibility of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

```typescript
GraphqlModule.forRoot({
  limits: {
    maxDepth: 8,      // Limit query nesting depth
    maxComplexity: 120, // Limit total field weight
    maxCost: 240,     // Limit estimated compute cost
  },
})
```

## 18.7 FluoShop Context: The Product Catalog

FluoShop uses GraphQL to provide a more fine-grained product catalog query experience. It applies DataLoader to category lookups and puts complexity limits on search endpoints so performance and safety are managed together.

```typescript
class CatalogSearchInput {
  @Arg('query')
  query = '';
}

@Resolver()
export class CatalogResolver {
  @Query({ input: CatalogSearchInput })
  async search(input: CatalogSearchInput) {
    // Complexity is calculated automatically based on the result set size.
    return this.catalogService.search(input.query);
  }
}
```

## 18.8 Conclusion

In Fluo, GraphQL is not a peripheral feature. It is an API layer connected to DI, the runtime facade, and Standard Decorators. This structure gives clients a flexible query model while leaving maintainable resolver boundaries on the server side.

In the next chapter, we'll cover how to persist the data that powers this API with **MongoDB and Mongoose**.
