# Chapter 14. Advanced Socket.IO

This chapter explains how to add a Socket.IO layer on top of raw WebSocket and connect high level realtime features such as rooms, namespaces, and broadcasting to FluoShop. Chapter 13 established a gateway based realtime surface. Now we expand it into maintainable Socket.IO patterns for multiple user chat and fine grained message control.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand why Socket.IO provides higher level collaboration features than raw WebSocket.
- Learn how to configure CORS and engine limits explicitly with `SocketIoModule.forRoot()`.
- Explain a structure that separates room joins from broadcasts with `SocketIoRoomService`.
- Analyze how namespaces and message Guards refine realtime security boundaries.
- Summarize the extension points provided by raw `Server` access and Bun engine support.
- Explain how to keep multiple room flows such as support chat testable.

## Prerequisites
- Complete Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 7, Chapter 8, Chapter 9, Chapter 10, Chapter 11, Chapter 12, and Chapter 13.
- A basic understanding of the WebSocket gateway lifecycle and realtime message routing.
- A basic sense of multiple user chat requirements such as authentication, room separation, and broadcast.

## 14.1 Why Socket.IO for FluoShop?

While `@fluojs/websockets` from Chapter 13 is a good fit for simple streams such as order updates, some features are hard to implement correctly with only raw sockets.

- **Rooms**: Broadcast messages to every user in "Support Ticket #123".
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Handle unstable mobile networks without losing application state.
- **Namespaces**: Separate "Public Chat" from "Internal Admin Alerts" within a single connection.
- **Broadcasting**: Send a message to everyone *except* the sender.

Socket.IO provides these features as first class concepts.

FluoShop uses Socket.IO for its customer support portal. Each support ticket is managed as a room, and each department is managed as a namespace.

## 14.2 Socket.IO module wiring

Registration follows the existing fluo pattern, with Socket.IO specific configuration added.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@fluojs/core';
import { SocketIoModule } from '@fluojs/socket.io';

@Module({
  imports: [
    SocketIoModule.forRoot({
      cors: {
        origin: ['https://fluoshop.com'],
      },
      engine: {
        maxHttpBufferSize: 1_048_576, // 1 MiB limit
      }
    }),
  ],
  providers: [SupportChatGateway],
})
export class ChatModule {}
```

By default, fluo keeps CORS deny by default, meaning `origin: false`.

To allow cross origin browser clients, you must explicitly write the allowed origin list.

The `engine` configuration maps directly to Engine.IO, letting you limit payload size for production stability.

## 14.3 Room management with SocketIoRoomService

One of Socket.IO's core features is room management.

When a customer opens a support ticket in FluoShop, the customer must join a room based on that ticket ID.

Instead of manipulating the socket object directly, fluo provides `SOCKETIO_ROOM_SERVICE`.

```typescript
import { 
  WebSocketGateway, 
  OnConnect, 
  OnMessage 
} from '@fluojs/websockets';
import { 
  SOCKETIO_ROOM_SERVICE, 
  type SocketIoRoomService 
} from '@fluojs/socket.io';
import { Inject } from '@fluojs/core';

@WebSocketGateway({ path: '/support' })
export class SupportChatGateway {
  constructor(
    @Inject(SOCKETIO_ROOM_SERVICE)
    private readonly rooms: SocketIoRoomService
  ) {}

  @OnMessage('join_ticket')
  handleJoin(payload: { ticketId: string }, socket: any) {
    const roomName = `ticket:${payload.ticketId}`;
    this.rooms.joinRoom(socket.id, roomName);
  }

  @OnMessage('send_message')
  handleMessage(payload: { ticketId: string, text: string }) {
    const roomName = `ticket:${payload.ticketId}`;
    this.rooms.broadcastToRoom(roomName, 'new_message', {
      text: payload.text,
      sender: 'user',
    });
  }
}
```

`SocketIoRoomService` separates room logic from the gateway.

With this structure, regular services that cannot access the original socket instance can still broadcast to a specific room.

## 14.4 Guarding namespaces and messages

Security in realtime systems often needs more detailed control than a simple handshake Guard.

You may want to allow connections to the `/support` namespace, but allow "send_message" only when the user is authenticated.

`SocketIoModule.forRoot` supports explicit auth Guards.

```typescript
SocketIoModule.forRoot({
  auth: {
    connection({ socket }) {
      // Namespace level authentication
      const token = socket.handshake.auth.token;
      return token === 'valid' ? true : { message: 'Authentication failed' };
    },
    message({ event, payload }) {
      // Message level authentication
      if (event === 'admin_command' && !payload.isAdmin) {
        return { message: 'Unauthorized command.' };
      }
      return true;
    }
  }
})
```

If these Guards return anything other than `true`, the connection or message is rejected with a standardized Socket.IO error object.

## 14.5 Accessing the raw server

Sometimes you need to go beyond the abstraction and access the underlying Socket.IO `Server` instance directly.

This is common when connecting a custom adapter such as a Redis adapter for multiple node scaling, or when listening to low level server events.

You can inject the raw server with the `SOCKETIO_SERVER` Token.

```typescript
import { SOCKETIO_SERVER } from '@fluojs/socket.io';
import type { Server } from 'socket.io';

export class ScalingService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(SOCKETIO_SERVER)
    private readonly io: Server
  ) {
    // Perform low level server setup
    console.log('Socket.IO Server instance is available');
  }
}
```

This boundary lets fluo provide a decorator based surface without blocking the extension points of the underlying library.

## 14.6 Bun engine details

fluo prioritizes support for Bun's high performance WebSocket implementation.

Socket.IO usually uses the `ws` package on Node.js.

On Bun, it can use `@socket.io/bun-engine`.

When FluoShop runs on Bun, the `@fluojs/socket.io` adapter automatically detects the environment and switches to the Bun engine when available.

This choice lets FluoShop handle many concurrent support chats with lower memory overhead than a standard Node.js process.

## 14.7 Broadcasting to multiple rooms

In the FluoShop support portal, an agent may need to broadcast a global announcement to every active ticket.

```typescript
@OnMessage('global_announcement')
handleAnnouncement(payload: { message: string }) {
  // Broadcast to multiple rooms at once
  this.rooms.broadcastToRoom(['ticket:active', 'staff:updates'], 'announcement', {
    text: payload.message
  });
}
```

The `broadcastToRoom` method accepts both a single string and an array of strings.

This matches the underlying Socket.IO behavior, but exposes it through an injectable service interface.

## 14.8 Handling volatile messages

Sometimes you need to send messages that are useful only *right now*.

For example, when a client is temporarily disconnected, you may not want that client to receive the message after reconnecting. This is the opposite of Socket.IO's default buffering behavior.

FluoShop examples include "user is typing" indicators or live cursor positions in dashboards.

With `SocketIoRoomService`, you can send volatile messages that are discarded if they cannot reach the client.

## 14.9 Testing Socket.IO gateways

fluo gateways are plain classes, so they are easy to test.

By mocking `SocketIoRoomService`, you can verify that a gateway joins the correct room and broadcasts the expected event without starting real network sockets.

```typescript
describe('SupportChatGateway', () => {
  it('joins the correct ticket room', () => {
    const mockRoomService = { joinRoom: vi.fn() };
    const gateway = new SupportChatGateway(mockRoomService as any);
    
    gateway.handleJoin({ ticketId: '123' }, { id: 'socket_abc' });
    
    expect(mockRoomService.joinRoom).toHaveBeenCalledWith('socket_abc', 'ticket:123');
  });
});
```

This testability is a core reason fluo treats room management as a service based concern instead of attaching methods to socket objects.

## 14.10 FluoShop support chat flow

With Socket.IO, the FluoShop support system can handle large scale realtime flows.

1. When a customer opens the support page, a connection to the `/support` namespace is triggered.
2. The `auth.connection` Guard verifies the customer's session.
3. When the customer clicks "Open ticket", the gateway joins the customer's socket to the `ticket:{id}` room.
4. Agents, in the admin namespace, can see all active tickets.
5. Messages are broadcast to a specific room, ensuring both privacy and performance.
6. In a Bun environment, the entire system runs on a highly efficient native engine.

This architecture lets FluoShop absorb growing customer support traffic through explicit realtime infrastructure.

## 14.11 Summary

- `@fluojs/socket.io` brings room, namespace, and broadcasting features into the fluo gateway system.
- `SocketIoRoomService` provides a high level API for room management that can be injected and tested.
- Explicit `auth` Guards for connections and messages provide fine grained security.
- `SOCKETIO_SERVER` provides low level server access when needed.
- Native Bun support ensures maximum performance on modern runtimes.
- The CORS default is `false` for safety, and explicit origin configuration is required.

Socket.IO is the bridge between simple ping pong sockets and real multiple user applications.

By integrating it with the fluo decorator system, FluoShop can use Socket.IO's high level features while preserving the modular architecture built in earlier chapters.
