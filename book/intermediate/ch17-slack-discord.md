# Chapter 17. Slack and Discord Integration

This chapter covers how to extend FluoShop's notification system into team communication channels. Chapter 16 established the email delivery foundation. Here, we connect operational alerts and real-time sharing flows with Slack and Discord.

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish how Slack and Discord integrations differ from the email channel.
- Review the process for registering chat Modules with a webhook-first delivery model.
- See how to use `SlackService` and `DiscordService` for standalone usage.
- Implement chat channel connections through `@fluojs/notifications`.
- Build structured messages with Block Kit and Embed.
- Operate chat integrations around retry policies and status snapshots.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Chapter 15 and Chapter 16.
- A basic understanding of webhook-based external service integrations.
- Experience designing operational notifications separately from team collaboration channels.

## 17.1 The Webhook-First Approach

For simple delivery, Fluo prioritizes **Incoming Webhooks**. When an application only needs to send notifications, this avoids the cost of managing OAuth tokens, bot permissions, and SDK lifecycles.

Both packages provide webhook transport helpers that work with only a `fetch` implementation.

```typescript
import { createSlackWebhookTransport } from '@fluojs/slack';

const transport = createSlackWebhookTransport({
  fetch: globalThis.fetch.bind(globalThis),
  webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX',
});
```

Because it depends on the standard `fetch` API, this transport works in the repository's Node.js 20+ baseline, Bun, Deno, and Cloudflare Workers without a separate adapter.

## 17.2 Registering the Chat Modules

Registration follows the same pattern as other fluo Modules. Fix operational defaults, such as the default channel or thread, in the Module configuration, then pass the runtime-specific `fetch` and webhook URL to the transport.

### Slack Registration
```typescript
import { SlackModule, createSlackWebhookTransport } from '@fluojs/slack';

@Module({
  imports: [
    SlackModule.forRoot({
      defaultChannel: '#ops-alerts',
      transport: createSlackWebhookTransport({
        fetch: runtime.fetch,
        webhookUrl: config.slackWebhookUrl,
      }),
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Discord Registration
```typescript
import { DiscordModule, createDiscordWebhookTransport } from '@fluojs/discord';

@Module({
  imports: [
    DiscordModule.forRoot({
      defaultThreadId: 'main-log',
      transport: createDiscordWebhookTransport({
        fetch: runtime.fetch,
        webhookUrl: config.discordWebhookUrl,
      }),
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## 17.3 Standalone Usage: SlackService & DiscordService

When orchestration would be too much, such as operational log records or custom alerts, you can use the services directly.

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@fluojs/core';
import { SlackService } from '@fluojs/slack';

@Inject(SlackService)
export class LoggerService {
  constructor(private readonly slack: SlackService) {}

  async logError(error: Error) {
    await this.slack.send({
      text: `🚨 *Critical Error*: ${error.message}`,
    });
  }
}
```

## 17.4 Integration with @fluojs/notifications

To include chat platforms in an orchestrated notification system, inject the `SLACK_CHANNEL` or `DISCORD_CHANNEL` Token. This lets event publishers stay unaware of channel-specific delivery details.

```typescript
import { SLACK_CHANNEL } from '@fluojs/slack';
import { DISCORD_CHANNEL } from '@fluojs/discord';

NotificationsModule.forRootAsync({
  inject: [SLACK_CHANNEL, DISCORD_CHANNEL],
  useFactory: (slack, discord) => ({
    channels: [slack, discord],
  }),
});
```

### Dispatching to Chat
```typescript
await this.notifications.dispatch({
  channel: 'slack',
  recipients: ['#customer-support'],
  subject: 'New Ticket Received',
  payload: {
    text: 'A new support ticket has been opened.',
    attachments: [{ color: '#f2c744', text: 'Ticket ID: 456' }],
  },
});
```

## 17.5 Rich Formatting: Blocks and Embeds

The strength of chat platforms is that they can structure messages in a form people can read and act on immediately. Structured blocks and embeds make information such as order IDs, status, and owners easier to scan than a plain string.

### Slack Blocks
The Slack package supports the **Block Kit** API, so you can structure messages with sections, fields, dividers, and more. For operational alerts, Block Kit helps separate the main status from supporting details inside the same message, making the alert easier to read than plain text.

```typescript
await this.slack.send({
  blocks: [
    {
      type: 'section',
      text: { type: 'mrkdwn', text: '*New Order Placed*' },
    },
    {
      type: 'divider',
    },
    {
      type: 'section',
      fields: [
        { type: 'mrkdwn', text: '*Order ID:*\n123' },
        { type: 'mrkdwn', text: '*Total:*\n$99.00' },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Discord Embeds
The Discord package supports **Embeds** for representing structured data. Titles, colors, fields, and descriptions help communicate the meaning of an order event quickly in community or public channels.

```typescript
await this.discord.send({
  content: 'Order Received!',
  embeds: [
    {
      title: 'Order #123',
      description: 'Items: 3',
      color: 0x00ff00,
    },
  ],
});
```

## 17.6 FluoShop Context: Operational Alerts

In FluoShop, Slack is used for internal operational notifications, while Discord is used for order notifications shared with the public community.

`NotificationsService` lets a single domain event route to one platform or several platforms based on policy.

```typescript
@OnEvent('order.placed')
async alertOps(event: OrderPlacedEvent) {
  // Notify developers through Slack
  await this.notifications.dispatch({
    channel: 'slack',
    payload: { text: `New order: ${event.orderId}` },
  });

  // Share with the community through Discord, if consent was given
  await this.notifications.dispatch({
    channel: 'discord',
    payload: { content: `A new order was just placed! 🚀` },
  });
}
```

## 17.7 Error Handling and Retries

The built-in webhook transports are designed around failure patterns seen in production environments.

- **Automatic retry**: Transient `408`, `429`, and `5xx` errors are retried with exponential backoff.
- **Explicit errors**: Permanent failures, such as 404 or 403, are surfaced as `SlackTransportError` or `DiscordTransportError` so the application level can handle them.

## 17.8 Status Snapshots

Chat integrations can stop working because webhook URLs expire, permissions change, or external services fail. Connect status snapshots to operational metrics and alerts so you can detect issues early.

```typescript
const slackStatus = slackService.createPlatformStatusSnapshot();
if (slackStatus.readiness.status !== 'ready') {
  metrics.increment('notifications.slack.offline');
}
```

## Conclusion

Integrating Slack and Discord into the fluo ecosystem lets the backend participate directly in team communication flows. It keeps runtime portability while adding real-time observability and structured message presentation.

This concludes **Part 4: Notification System**. So far, we have covered a strategy for handling user notifications and team operational notifications within the same orchestration model.
