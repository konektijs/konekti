# release readiness summary

<p><strong><kbd>English</kbd></strong> <a href="./release-readiness-summary.ko.md"><kbd>한국어</kbd></a></p>

- [x] Canonical bootstrap docs — The quick start guide documents the public `pnpm add -g @fluojs/cli` + `fluo new` path.
- [x] Repo-local smoke path docs — The repo-local sandbox path is documented in CONTRIBUTING.md as monorepo verification support.
- [x] Starter shape and runtime ownership — The generated starter uses runtime-owned bootstrap helpers plus a starter-owned greeting module, without default metrics or OpenAPI surfaces.
- [x] Generic-first bootstrap contract — Bootstrap docs and scaffold source no longer encode ORM/DB prompts, support tiers, or starter-time ORM adapter injection.
- [x] Toolchain contract lock — The toolchain contract matrix documents the generated app baseline plus the canonical fluo command surfaces.
- [x] Manifest benchmark evidence — Release governance documents the canonical publish surface and the automated release gates.
- [x] Dist-based package entrypoints — CLI manifest and bin prove a dist-backed public `fluo` entrypoint with a subordinate compatibility alias.
- [x] Root OSS license file — A repository-level OSS license file exists at the root.
- [x] Public changelog baseline — CHANGELOG.md exists with Keep a Changelog baseline sections for Unreleased and current 0.x history.
- [x] Public package surface docs are synchronized — release-governance and package-surface docs declare the same @fluojs public package list.
- [x] Documented public packages exist in workspace — Every documented public package maps to an existing workspace package manifest.
