# 릴리즈 후보 검증 요약

<p><a href="./release-candidate-summary.md"><kbd>English</kbd></a> <strong><kbd>한국어</kbd></strong></p>

- [x] Canonical bootstrap docs — The quick start guide documents the public `pnpm add -g @konekti/cli` + `konekti new` path.
- [x] Repo-local smoke path docs — The repo-local sandbox path is documented in the CLI README as monorepo-only verification support.
- [x] Starter shape and runtime ownership — The generated starter uses runtime-owned bootstrap helpers plus a starter-owned health module, without default metrics or OpenAPI surfaces.
- [x] Generic-first bootstrap contract — Bootstrap docs and scaffold source no longer encode ORM/DB prompts, support tiers, or starter-time ORM adapter injection.
- [x] Toolchain contract lock — The toolchain contract matrix is locked with public/generated/internal statuses.
- [x] Manifest benchmark evidence — Release docs still point at the benchmark-backed manifest decision snapshot.
- [x] Dist-based package entrypoints — CLI manifest and bin prove a dist-backed public entrypoint.

- 실행한 명령: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`
