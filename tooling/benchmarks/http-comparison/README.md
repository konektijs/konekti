# HTTP runtime benchmark

Runs a small HTTP throughput/latency comparison between published fluo beta packages and NestJS v11 across three targets:

- `Nest+Fastify`
- `fluo+Fastify`
- `fluo+Bun`

## Scenarios

- `baseline`: a single no-param baseline route used to measure the adapter/framework response floor.
- `di-chain-dto-deterministic-1`: one DTO-bound path route through Controller → Service → Repository.
- `di-chain-dto-deterministic-20`: the same DTO-bound DI path across a deterministic 20-route cycle.
- `di-chain-direct-param-deterministic-1`: one direct path-param route through Controller → Service → Repository.
- `di-chain-direct-param-deterministic-20`: the same direct-param DI path across a deterministic 20-route cycle.

## Run

```bash
pnpm --dir tooling/benchmarks/http-comparison --ignore-workspace install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir tooling/benchmarks/http-comparison --ignore-workspace bench
```

This benchmark has its own lockfile and is intentionally excluded from the root pnpm workspace. It consumes the versions that are already published to npm so repository release jobs do not need unpublished package versions before they can publish them.

The runner starts an isolated server set for each scenario, so 1-route and 20-route scenarios register different app shapes instead of merely sending different request paths through the same route table. It warms every target for each scenario, then measures with `autocannon` at 100 connections for 40 seconds. Measurement order rotates by scenario to avoid always giving one framework the same position. Multi-route scenarios use a deterministic path cycle so every target sees the same request sequence.

For quick directional runs, override the defaults with environment variables:

```bash
BENCH_WARMUP_SEC=3 BENCH_MEASURE_SEC=10 pnpm --dir tooling/benchmarks/http-comparison --ignore-workspace bench
```

The `fluo+Bun` target requires the `bun` CLI because `@fluojs/platform-bun` uses `globalThis.Bun.serve()` at listen time.

## Correctness gates

Each warm-up and measured run validates the expected response body and fails on:

- connection errors
- timeouts
- non-2xx responses
- body mismatches

The report prints those counters with throughput and latency metrics.

## Scope and caveats

- This measures the released npm beta surface, not unpublished workspace source changes.
- fluo uses TC39 standard decorators without `emitDecoratorMetadata`; NestJS uses legacy decorators with `emitDecoratorMetadata` through `nestjs/tsconfig.json`.
- `fluo+Bun` is a runtime comparison, not a same-adapter comparison. Treat it as “same fluo app graph on Bun’s native server” versus the Node.js adapter targets.
- The suite only covers routing and one constructor-DI path. It does not measure validation, serialization plugins, guards, pipes, database access, or production middleware.
