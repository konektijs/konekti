## Installation

```bash
npm install @fluojs/cqrs
```

## When to Use

- When you want to decouple the "intent" (Commands/Queries) from the "execution" (Handlers).
- When implementing complex business logic that requires clear separation between write models and read models.
- When orchestrating multi-step processes (Sagas) triggered by domain events.
- When you need a centralized bus for commands, queries, and events within a single application.

## Quick Start

Register the `CqrsModule` and define your first command and handler.

Use `CqrsModule.forRoot(...)` to wire CQRS buses and handler discovery.

```typescript
import { Inject, Module } from '@fluojs/core';
import {
  CqrsModule,
  CommandHandler,
  ICommand,
  ICommandHandler,
  CommandBusLifecycleService,
} from '@fluojs/cqrs';

// 1. Define a Command
class CreateUserCommand implements ICommand {
  constructor(public readonly name: string) {}
}

// 2. Implement the Handler
@CommandHandler(CreateUserCommand)
class CreateUserHandler implements ICommandHandler<CreateUserCommand, string> {
  async execute(command: CreateUserCommand): Promise<string> {
    console.log(`Creating user: ${command.name}`);
    return 'user-id-123';
  }
}

// 3. Use the Command Bus
@Inject(CommandBusLifecycleService)
class UserService {
  constructor(private readonly commandBus: CommandBusLifecycleService) {}

  async create(name: string) {
    return this.commandBus.execute(new CreateUserCommand(name));
  }
}

@Module({
  imports: [CqrsModule.forRoot()],
  providers: [CreateUserHandler, UserService],
})
class AppModule {}
```

## Common Patterns

### Saga Process Managers

Sagas allow you to listen for events and trigger new commands, enabling complex long-running workflows.

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@fluojs/core';
import { Saga, ISaga, IEvent, ICommand, CommandBusLifecycleService } from '@fluojs/cqrs';

class UserCreatedEvent implements IEvent {
  constructor(public readonly userId: string) {}
}

class SendWelcomeEmailCommand implements ICommand {
  constructor(public readonly userId: string) {}
}

@Inject(CommandBusLifecycleService)
@Saga(UserCreatedEvent)
class UserSaga implements ISaga<UserCreatedEvent> {
  constructor(private readonly commandBus: CommandBusLifecycleService) {}

  async handle(event: UserCreatedEvent): Promise<void> {
    await this.commandBus.execute(new SendWelcomeEmailCommand(event.userId));
  }
}
```

Saga execution now fails fast with `SagaTopologyError` when an in-process publish chain re-enters the same saga route cyclically or exceeds 32 nested saga hops. Multi-stage sagas may still react to different event types in sequence, but in-process saga graphs must stay acyclic overall; move intentionally cyclic or long-running feedback loops behind an external transport, scheduler, or other bounded boundary.

### Event Publishing Contracts

`CqrsEventBusService.publish(event)` runs the CQRS event pipeline in a fixed order: matching `@EventHandler(...)` providers first, matching `@Saga(...)` providers second, and delegated `@fluojs/event-bus` publication last. `publishAll(events)` preserves the input order by awaiting each event's full pipeline before publishing the next event.

Each CQRS event handler and saga receives an isolated event copy with the matched event prototype restored. Mutating that copy is local to the current handler or saga route; those mutations are not visible to other CQRS handlers, sagas, the original event object, or delegated `@fluojs/event-bus` subscribers. The delegated event-bus publication receives the original event after CQRS side effects complete, so `@OnEvent(...)` projections and transports observe the caller-owned payload rather than a CQRS handler's mutated copy.

Event classes should keep their payload state cloneable and enumerable. String-keyed and symbol-keyed enumerable payload fields are preserved by the shared core clone fallback, while intentionally non-cloneable resources such as open sockets, functions, or process-local handles should be represented by IDs or other serializable boundaries before publishing.

### Symbol Tokens

Use these exports when you want explicit symbol tokens for the CQRS buses:

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@fluojs/core';
import { COMMAND_BUS, QUERY_BUS, EVENT_BUS } from '@fluojs/cqrs';

@Inject(COMMAND_BUS, QUERY_BUS, EVENT_BUS)
class TokenInjectedService {
  constructor(commandBus, queryBus, eventBus) {}
}
```

## Public API Overview

### Modules & Providers
- `CqrsModule.forRoot(options)`: Main entry point. Registers buses and starts discovery.
- `CommandBusLifecycleService`: Primary service for executing commands.
- `QueryBusLifecycleService`: Primary service for executing queries.
- `CqrsEventBusService`: Primary service for publishing events.

### Decorators
- `@CommandHandler(Command)`: Associates a class with a Command.
- `@QueryHandler(Query)`: Associates a class with a Query.
- `@EventHandler(Event)`: Associates a class with an Event.
- `@Saga(Event | Event[])`: Marks a class as a Saga listener.

### Interfaces
- `ICommand`, `IQuery<T>`, `IEvent`: Marker interfaces for messages.
- `ICommandHandler<C, R>`, `IQueryHandler<Q, R>`, `IEventHandler<E>`, `ISaga<E>`: Handler contracts.

### Errors
- `SagaTopologyError`: Raised when saga orchestration detects a self-triggering, cyclic, or over-deep in-process saga graph.

## Related Packages

- `@fluojs/event-bus`: Underlying event distribution used by `CqrsEventBusService`.
- `@fluojs/core`: Required for `@Module` and `@Inject` decorators.
