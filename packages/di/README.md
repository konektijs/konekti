## Installation

```bash
npm install @fluojs/di
```

## When to Use

Use this package when you need to:
- Resolve classes and their dependencies at runtime.
- Manage object lifetimes (Singleton, Request, Transient).
- Override implementations for testing or environment-specific needs.
- Create isolated request-scoped containers for HTTP or background tasks.

## Quick Start

The container resolves tokens into instances based on their registered providers.

```typescript
import { Container } from '@fluojs/di';
import { Inject, Scope } from '@fluojs/core';

class Logger {
  log(msg: string) { console.log(msg); }
}

@Inject(Logger)
@Scope('singleton')
class UserService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}
  
  async getStatus() {
    this.logger.log('Checking status...');
    return { status: 'active' };
  }
}

const container = new Container();
container.register(Logger, UserService);

const service = await container.resolve(UserService);
const result = await service.getStatus();
```

## Key Capabilities

### Provider Types
fluo DI supports three main provider shapes:
- **Class Providers**: `container.register(MyService)` or `{ provide: MyToken, useClass: MyService }`.
- **Value Providers**: `{ provide: 'API_URL', useValue: 'https://api.example.com' }`.
- **Factory Providers**: `{ provide: 'ASYNC_CONFIG', useFactory: async (db) => await db.load(), inject: [Database] }`.
- **Alias Providers**: `{ provide: ILogger, useExisting: PinoLogger }` allows mapping one token to another existing provider.

### Scope Management
- **Singleton** (Default): Instance is created once and shared across the entire container.
- **Request**: Instance is created once per `createRequestScope()` call.
- **Transient**: A new instance is created every time it is resolved.

### Request Scoping
Isolated containers can be created to handle per-request state without polluting the root container.

```typescript
const requestContainer = container.createRequestScope();
const scopedService = await requestContainer.resolve(RequestScopedService);
```

Request-scope containers may resolve providers from their parent chain, but request-owned registrations must not introduce new singleton providers. Register singleton providers on the root container before creating request scopes. If a request scope needs local additions, declare them with `scope: 'request'`/`Scope.REQUEST` or use `override()` for an explicit request-local replacement. The same rule applies to multi providers: default-scope multi providers belong on the root container, while request-local multi providers must opt into request scope or be replaced through `override()`.

Provider objects are validated at registration time: every object provider must include a non-null `provide` token and exactly one strategy (`useClass`, `useValue`, `useFactory`, or `useExisting`). Invalid provider shapes throw `InvalidProviderError` before they can affect the container graph.

## Circular Dependency Handling

The container automatically detects circular dependencies and throws a `CircularDependencyError` to prevent infinite loops. This includes direct (A→A), two-node (A→B→A), and deep (A→B→C→A) cycles.

To resolve a circular dependency, use `forwardRef()` to defer the resolution of the dependent token.

```typescript
import { forwardRef } from '@fluojs/di';
import { Inject } from '@fluojs/core';

@Inject(forwardRef(() => ServiceB))
class ServiceA {
  constructor(private serviceB: any) {}
}

@Inject(forwardRef(() => ServiceA))
class ServiceB {
  constructor(private serviceA: any) {}
}
```

## Testing and Mocking

You can easily override providers in the container to use mocks or stubs during unit testing by using `useValue`.

```typescript
import { Container } from '@fluojs/di';

const container = new Container();
const mockDb = { query: jest.fn() };

// Override the real Database class with a mock value
container.register({ 
  provide: Database, 
  useValue: mockDb 
});

const service = await container.resolve(DataService);
// service will now use mockDb instead of the real Database instance
```

## Troubleshooting

### CircularDependencyError
Thrown when the container detects a cycle in the dependency graph. Check your constructor injections and use `forwardRef()` where necessary to break the cycle.

### Token Not Found
Ensure all required providers are registered in the container. If you use `createRequestScope()`, the child container can resolve tokens from the parent, but not vice versa.

## Public API

| Class/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Container` | The main DI container class. |
| `register(...providers)` | Registers one or more providers. |
| `resolve<T>(token)` | Asynchronously resolves a token to an instance. |
| `createRequestScope()` | Creates a child container for request-scoped dependencies. |
| `has(token)` | Checks if a token is registered in the container or its parents. |
| `hasRequestScopedDependency(token)` | Checks whether resolving a token may require a request-scope container because its provider graph contains request-scoped dependencies or is cyclic. |
