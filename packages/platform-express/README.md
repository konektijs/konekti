## Installation

```bash
npm install @fluojs/platform-express express
```

## When to Use

Use this package when you want to run a fluo application using Express as the underlying HTTP engine. This is useful for leveraging Express's robust ecosystem, mature Node.js server handling, and familiar request/response lifecycle within the fluo decorator-based architecture.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { createExpressAdapter } from '@fluojs/platform-express';
import { fluoFactory } from '@fluojs/runtime';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

const app = await fluoFactory.create(AppModule, {
  adapter: createExpressAdapter({ port: 3000 }),
});

await app.listen();
```

## Common Patterns

### Handling Streaming Responses (SSE)
The Express adapter supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) via the shared `SseResponse` utility, abstracting away the Express-specific stream handling.

```typescript
@Get('events')
async streamEvents(@Res() res: FrameworkResponse) {
  const events = new SseResponse();
  events.send({ data: 'hello' });
  return events;
}
```

### Body Parsing and Multipart
The adapter handles `rawBody` and multipart form-data parsing out of the box. When you construct the adapter directly, pass multipart limits as the second argument. `bootstrapExpressApplication(...)` and `runExpressApplication(...)` accept the same multipart settings under `options.multipart`. When `multipart.maxTotalSize` is not set, `maxBodySize` becomes the default total multipart payload cap so body-size limits stay portable across HTTP adapters.

```typescript
const adapter = createExpressAdapter(
  {
    port: 3000,
    rawBody: true,
  },
  {
    maxTotalSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024,
  },
);
```

### Native Route Registration with Safe Fallback
The adapter now pre-registers semantically safe Express Router handlers for explicit HTTP methods and still dispatches those requests through the shared fluo dispatcher.

This keeps guards, interceptors, observers, body parsing, raw body capture, SSE, and error responses on the same framework-owned execution path while allowing Express to short-circuit some path matching work first.

To avoid changing documented fluo semantics, overlapping same-shape param routes such as `/:id` and `/:slug`, `@All(...)` handlers, `OPTIONS` ownership, and requests that rely on fluo's duplicate-slash/trailing-slash normalization stay on the catch-all fallback path.

## Adapter Contract

- **Shared dispatcher ownership**: Native Express Router matches still hand off to the shared fluo dispatcher, so middleware, guards, interceptors, observers, params, and error envelopes remain framework-defined.
- **Safe fallback scope**: `@All(...)` handlers and overlapping same-shape param routes intentionally stay on the catch-all fallback path instead of being force-registered through Express Router.
- **OPTIONS ownership parity**: The adapter prevents Express Router from auto-answering `OPTIONS` for native routes, so unsupported methods still fall through to fluo dispatcher semantics and `@All(...)` handlers can continue to own `OPTIONS` when defined.
- **Path normalization parity**: Requests that Express Router does not normalize the same way as fluo, such as duplicate-slash variants, still resolve through fallback dispatch so fluo's normalized route contract is preserved.
- **Versioning parity**: Header/media-type/custom version selection remains dispatcher-owned even when Express Router handles the initial path match.

## Public API Overview

- `createExpressAdapter(options)`: Factory for the Express HTTP adapter.
- `bootstrapExpressApplication(module, options)`: Advanced bootstrap helper for manual control.
- `runExpressApplication(module, options)`: Compatibility helper for quick startup with signal wiring. On timeout/failure it reports the condition through logging and `process.exitCode`, while leaving final process termination to the surrounding host.
- `ExpressHttpApplicationAdapter`: The core adapter implementation class.
