Reduce module and class DI metadata read-path allocations by returning frozen snapshots that may reuse stable references between metadata writes. Migration caveat: consumers of `@fluojs/core/internal` must treat `getModuleMetadata()`, `getOwnClassDiMetadata()`, `getInheritedClassDiMetadata()`, and `getClassDiMetadata()` results, their collection fields, and module provider descriptor wrappers and middleware route-config wrappers (including their `routes` arrays) as immutable. `useValue` payload objects and runtime middleware/guard/interceptor instances remain mutable references and are not frozen by this change.
