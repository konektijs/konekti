# contributing to konekti

Konekti is built on standard TypeScript decorators and explicit contract discipline. This guide explains how to set up your environment, verify changes, and follow our maintainer workflows.

## local development setup

Konekti uses a monorepo structure managed by `pnpm`.

1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js 20+ and `pnpm`.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
3. **Build all packages**:
   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```
4. **Run tests across monorepo**:
   ```sh
   pnpm test
   ```

## maintainer workflows

### CLI sandbox verification

When modifying `@konekti/cli` or core runtime packages, use the sandbox scripts to verify end-to-end behavior.

Inside `packages/cli/`:
- `pnpm sandbox:create`: Generates a fresh starter app in a temporary directory.
- `pnpm sandbox:verify`: Runs `build`, `typecheck`, and `test` inside the sandbox app.
- `pnpm sandbox:test`: Runs integration tests against the sandbox app.
- `pnpm sandbox:clean`: Removes the sandbox directory.

### using worktrees

We recommend using `git worktree` for multi-tasking or resolving issues in isolation.
- Our canonical worktree path is `.worktrees/`.
- `git worktree add -b issue-123 .worktrees/issue-123 origin/main`

## behavioral contracts

Konekti maintains strict behavioral contracts. Before opening a PR, ensure you have:
1. Read the affected package `README.md`.
2. Checked [docs/operations/behavioral-contract-policy.md](docs/operations/behavioral-contract-policy.md).
3. Updated documentation if runtime behavior or API surface changed.
4. Added regression tests for any contract-affecting changes.

## issue intake

- Use **Bug Report** for reproducible errors in the framework or CLI.
- Use **DX/Maintainability Request** for developer experience improvements or refactoring suggestions.
- For feature requests, start with an issue to discuss the design before implementation.

## PR process

- All PRs should target the `main` branch.
- Follow the structure in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Ensure all CI checks (lint, build, test) pass locally before pushing.
