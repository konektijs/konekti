# http runtime

This guide describes the current HTTP execution model across `@konekti/http`, `@konekti/runtime`, auth packages, and the generated starter app.

## request lifecycle

```text
HTTP adapter
-> RequestContext creation
-> app middleware
-> route match
-> module middleware
-> guard chain
-> interceptor chain
-> request DTO binding
-> DTO validation
-> controller invocation
-> success status resolution
-> response write
-> exception mapping when needed
```

## success status defaults

Without an explicit override, the dispatcher uses method-based success defaults:

- `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `HEAD` -> `200`
- `POST` -> `201`
- `DELETE`, `OPTIONS` -> `204` when the final resolved value is `undefined`, otherwise `200`

`@SuccessStatus(code)` always overrides those defaults.

The decision happens after the interceptor chain resolves, so interceptor result shaping still affects the final default status.

## DTO boundary

- request DTO binding belongs to `@konekti/http`
- field source decorators such as `@FromBody()` and `@FromPath()` also belong to `@konekti/http`
- validation decorators such as `@IsString()` and `@MinLength()` belong to `@konekti/dto-validator`

The runtime treats request DTOs as an explicit boundary, not a convenience copy step.

## starter-app HTTP policies

The generated starter keeps a few HTTP defaults consistent:

- runtime-owned `/health` and `/ready`
- `/metrics` through `@konekti/metrics`
- `/openapi.json` through `@konekti/openapi`
- default CORS policy driven by runtime bootstrap config

These defaults live above any single package README because they describe how packages are composed in the starter app.
