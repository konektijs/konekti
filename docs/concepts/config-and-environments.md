# config and environments

This guide outlines the configuration management implemented across `@konekti/config`, the runtime bootstrap process, and package integrations.

### related documentation

- `../../packages/config/README.md`
- `./lifecycle-and-shutdown.md`
- `../getting-started/bootstrap-paths.md`

## responsibilities

- **`@konekti/config`**: Handles configuration loading, precedence, validation, and typed access.
- **Bootstrap**: Consumes pre-loaded configurations instead of re-reading environment variables.
- **Integrations**: Should use typed configuration providers rather than direct environment access.

## core configuration principles

- **Explicit Mode Selection**: Choose between `dev`, `prod`, and `test`.
- **Deterministic Precedence**: One clear order for configuration resolution.
- **Early Validation**: Configuration is validated at application startup.
- **Typed Access**: Configurations are accessed via `ConfigService`.

## environments and files

The following environments and corresponding file patterns are supported:

- **Official Modes**: `dev`, `prod`, `test`
- **Default Files**:
  - `.env.dev`
  - `.env.prod`
  - `.env.test`

## precedence and merging

The configuration resolution order is deterministic:

1.  **Runtime Overrides**: Passed directly during bootstrap.
2.  **Process Environment**: Standard system environment variables.
3.  **Mode-specific Files**: Based on the active application mode.
4.  **Default Values**: Hardcoded fallback values.

### merge behavior

- **Objects**: Plain objects are deep-merged across all sources.
- **Primitives and Arrays**: These follow the precedence order and replace existing values.
- **Safety**: Nested overrides must not inadvertently remove neighboring keys.

## validation and security

- **Fail-fast**: Invalid configurations prevent the application from starting.
- **Coercion**: Types are coerced once during the bootstrap phase.
- **Secrets**: Follow the standard precedence model but are never included in logs or error messages.

## usage recommendations

Use `ConfigService` for general application configuration. For complex integrations, prefer the typed configuration providers provided by those specific packages.
