# CQRS Contract

<p><strong><kbd>English</kbd></strong> <a href="./cqrs.ko.md"><kbd>한국어</kbd></a></p>

This document defines the current CQRS contract implemented by `@fluojs/cqrs` and `@fluojs/event-bus`.

## Message Separation Rules

| Message type | Dispatch surface | Resolution model | Current contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command | `CommandBusLifecycleService.execute(...)` or `COMMAND_BUS.execute(...)` | One command type to one singleton handler | A command resolves by constructor identity. Missing handlers fail with `CommandHandlerNotFoundException`. Duplicate singleton handlers for the same command fail discovery with `DuplicateCommandHandlerError`. |
| Query | `QueryBusLifecycleService.execute(...)` or `QUERY_BUS.execute(...)` | One query type to one singleton handler | A query resolves by constructor identity. Missing handlers fail with `QueryHandlerNotFoundException`. Duplicate singleton handlers for the same query fail discovery with `DuplicateQueryHandlerError`. |
| Event | `CqrsEventBusService.publish(...)` or `EVENT_BUS.publish(...)` | One event type to zero or more singleton handlers | Event handlers are matched with `instanceof` against the published event type. Local handlers run first, then saga dispatch, then delegated publication through `@fluojs/event-bus`. |
| Saga trigger | `@Saga(Event)` or `@Saga([EventA, EventB])` | One saga class to one or more event types | Saga metadata is attached to singleton providers and discovered at bootstrap. One saga may listen to multiple event constructors. |

## Handler Registration Rules

| Rule | Current contract | Source anchor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module entrypoint | Applications register CQRS through `CqrsModule.forRoot(...)`. The module is global and exports lifecycle services plus the `COMMAND_BUS`, `QUERY_BUS`, and `EVENT_BUS` compatibility tokens. | `packages/cqrs/src/module.ts` |
| Decorator metadata | `@CommandHandler(...)`, `@QueryHandler(...)`, `@EventHandler(...)`, and `@Saga(...)` store standard-decorator metadata on the target class. | `packages/cqrs/src/decorators.ts`, `packages/cqrs/src/metadata.ts` |
| Optional eager registration | `CqrsModule.forRoot({ commandHandlers, queryHandlers, eventHandlers, sagas })` adds those classes to the provider list, but discovery still reads the same handler metadata. | `packages/cqrs/src/module.ts` |
| Singleton-only discovery | Command handlers, query handlers, event handlers, and sagas are registered only when the provider scope is `singleton`. Non-singleton candidates are skipped with a logger warning. | `packages/cqrs/src/buses/command-bus.ts`, `packages/cqrs/src/buses/query-bus.ts`, `packages/cqrs/src/buses/event-bus.ts`, `packages/cqrs/src/buses/saga-bus.ts` |
| Handler shape | Command and query handlers MUST implement `execute(...)`. Event handlers and sagas MUST implement `handle(...)`. Violations fail at dispatch with `InvariantError`. | `packages/cqrs/src/buses/command-bus.ts`, `packages/cqrs/src/buses/query-bus.ts`, `packages/cqrs/src/buses/event-bus.ts`, `packages/cqrs/src/buses/saga-bus.ts` |
| Saga event list | `@Saga()` requires at least one event constructor and rejects non-class event values. Duplicate event constructors in one decorator call are deduplicated. | `packages/cqrs/src/decorators.ts` |

## Bus and Lifecycle Boundaries

| Surface | Current behavior | Source anchor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Command bus | Discovers handlers once, preloads handler instances, then dispatches one command to one handler. | `packages/cqrs/src/buses/command-bus.ts` |
| Query bus | Discovers handlers once, preloads handler instances, then dispatches one query to one handler. | `packages/cqrs/src/buses/query-bus.ts` |
| CQRS event bus | Publishes to matching local event handlers, then to the saga lifecycle service, then to the shared `@fluojs/event-bus` transport. | `packages/cqrs/src/buses/event-bus.ts` |
| Saga runtime | Serializes execution per saga token, tracks active dispatch context with `AsyncLocalStorage`, and reports runtime snapshot data for diagnostics. | `packages/cqrs/src/buses/saga-bus.ts` |
| Shutdown behavior | The saga runtime waits for in-flight dispatches during shutdown before clearing descriptors and cached handler instances. | `packages/cqrs/src/buses/saga-bus.ts` |

## Constraints

- Command and query routing is constructor-based and point-to-point. One message type cannot intentionally resolve to multiple singleton handlers.
- Event handling is in-process by default. `CqrsEventBusService` delegates the final publication step to `@fluojs/event-bus`, but the CQRS package itself does not provide a distributed broker contract.
- Saga orchestration is guarded against unsafe re-entry. Re-entering the same saga route or exceeding the nested depth limit of `32` fails with `SagaTopologyError`.
- Sagas that throw non-Fluo errors are wrapped as `SagaExecutionError`.
- The CQRS package relies on TC39 standard decorators and explicit metadata storage. It does not depend on legacy decorator compiler modes.
