# Versioning & Release Rules

<p><strong><kbd>English</kbd></strong> <a href="./release-governance.ko.md"><kbd>한국어</kbd></a></p>

## Stability Tiers

| Tier | Version window | Release rule | Contract level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Experimental | `0.x` | Public APIs may change in a minor release. Prerelease versions must publish under a non-`latest` dist-tag. | No stable upgrade guarantee. |
| Preview | `0.x` or prerelease builds | Packages are intended for public use, but breaking changes still follow the `0.x` minor-bump rule and require migration notes in `CHANGELOG.md`. | Documented behavior should stay aligned with tests and release notes. |
| Official | `1.0+` | Stable releases publish under `latest`. Breaking changes require a major version bump. | Public API, documented behavior, and release process are treated as stable contracts. |

## Semver Rules

- All public `@fluojs/*` packages follow Semantic Versioning.
- `major` is required for breaking changes in `1.0+`.
- `minor` is used for backward-compatible feature work, and it is also the required bump for breaking changes during `0.x`.
- `patch` is limited to backward-compatible fixes, security fixes, and documentation or tooling updates that preserve documented behavior.
- Prerelease versions are versions with a hyphen suffix. They must publish under a non-`latest` dist-tag such as `next`, `beta`, or `rc`.
- Stable versions without a prerelease suffix must publish under the `latest` dist-tag.
- Intended public package manifests must use `workspace:^` for internal `@fluojs/*` dependencies across dependency, optional dependency, peer dependency, and dev dependency fields.

## Breaking Change Rules

- Treat API shape changes, documented behavior changes, configuration shape changes, bootstrap-order changes, adapter-contract changes, and public package removals as breaking when existing consumer code or configuration must change to keep working.
- In `0.x`, a breaking change may ship only in a minor release, and the release must include a migration note in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- In `1.0+`, a breaking change must ship in a major release.
- Do not classify a change as patch or minor when it changes documented guarantees for lifecycle ordering, shutdown behavior, adapter behavior, readiness behavior, or public CLI and starter contracts.
- Update implementation, tests, and governed docs together when a breaking rule changes.

## Graduation Requirements

A package is ready for `1.0` and the Official tier only when all of the following stay true:

1. The package is an existing workspace package under `packages/*`, remains public, and keeps `publishConfig.access` set to `public`.
2. The package appears in both `docs/reference/package-surface.md` and the `## intended publish surface` list in this document.
3. Public exports satisfy the repository TSDoc baseline, and contract-governing docs keep English and Korean parity.
4. Release verification passes the canonical repository commands: `pnpm build`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm vitest run --project packages`, `pnpm vitest run --project apps`, `pnpm vitest run --project examples`, `pnpm vitest run --project tooling`, `pnpm --dir packages/cli sandbox:matrix`, `pnpm verify:platform-consistency-governance`, and `pnpm verify:release-readiness`.
5. `CHANGELOG.md` keeps the `## [Unreleased]` section, and every `0.x` breaking release includes migration notes before a stable `1.0+` contract is declared.

## Release Metadata Contract

Changesets (`.changeset/*.md`) is the canonical release metadata tool. Contributors record semver intent and changelog text in committed changeset files at PR time; the Changesets GitHub Action consumes those files to version packages, generate changelogs, and publish to npm. Package-level changelogs are generated automatically, and the root `CHANGELOG.md` remains available for repo-wide narrative. GitHub Releases are created automatically by the Changesets action.

Each changeset must include:

1. Affected package names, using the published `@fluojs/*` package name.
2. Semver intent per package, one of `major`, `minor`, or `patch`.
3. A summary describing the change for consumers and release reviewers.

Packages that are not listed in a changeset are not versioned or published for that release. Downstream dependent packages are evaluated through Changesets' internal dependency graph; dependent version bumps are computed automatically during versioning.

The release workflow is triggered automatically on pushes to `main`. When pending changesets exist, the Changesets action opens a "Version Packages" PR that bumps versions, updates changelogs, and removes consumed changesets. Merging that PR triggers the publish step, which publishes affected packages to npm with token-backed npm authentication and provenance, then creates scoped git tags and GitHub Releases.

Prerelease workflow uses Changesets prerelease mode (`changeset pre enter <tag>`). Enter prerelease mode on a dedicated branch when needed; exit with `changeset pre exit` before stable releases.

Legacy `tooling/release/intents/*.json` records are retained for historical reference but are no longer required for new releases.


## Migration Assessment: Changesets and Beachball

Changesets has been adopted as the primary release automation tool. It replaces the previous repo-local JSON intent model with a standard contributor-authored changeset workflow. The `.github/workflows/release.yml` handles versioning, publishing, and GitHub Release creation automatically.

The previous single-package manual dispatch workflow is deprecated. The new workflow publishes all packages with pending changesets when the Version Packages PR is merged, while preserving CI-only, token-authenticated, provenance-enabled `main`-branch publishing.

Beachball remains a valid comparison point but is not adopted. The evaluation criteria below are preserved for future reference if Changesets proves unsuitable:

1. **Packages per release**: Changesets handles multiple packages per release automatically.
2. **Downstream evaluation frequency**: Changesets computes and bumps dependent packages automatically during versioning.
3. **Intent maintenance cost**: Changeset files are authored at PR time by contributors, reducing maintainer release-time work.
4. **Generated package changelog need**: Changesets generates per-package changelogs automatically.
5. **CI-only compatibility**: The new `.github/workflows/release.yml` maintains CI-only publish with npm token authentication and provenance.

## Enforcement

Run these commands when versioning rules, release-governing docs, or intended publish surface packages change:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm vitest run --project packages
pnpm vitest run --project apps
pnpm vitest run --project examples
pnpm vitest run --project tooling
pnpm --dir packages/cli sandbox:matrix
pnpm verify:public-export-tsdoc
pnpm verify:platform-consistency-governance
pnpm verify:release-readiness
pnpm generate:release-readiness-drafts
pnpm changeset status --since=main
```

- `pnpm verify:platform-consistency-governance` checks heading parity and governed documentation consistency.
- `pnpm verify:release-readiness` reuses the canonical build, typecheck, split Vitest, sandbox, package-surface sync, and publish-safety checks.
- `pnpm verify:public-export-tsdoc` enforces the public export documentation baseline used by governed packages.
- `pnpm generate:release-readiness-drafts` refreshes draft release-readiness summary artifacts and the draft release block in `CHANGELOG.md` when maintainers prepare notes.
- `pnpm changeset status --since=main` previews the packages and semver buckets Changesets will version before the Version Packages PR is merged.
