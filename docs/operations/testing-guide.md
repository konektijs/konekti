# Testing Guide

</p>

This document defines the testing architecture and verification policies for the fluo framework. It serves as the authoritative guide for both framework contributors and application developers to ensure reliable, metadata-free verification of system behavior.

## When this document matters

- **Core Contribution**: When adding new features or fixing bugs in `@fluojs/*` packages.
- **Platform Authorship**: When creating new runtimes or third-party extensions.
- **Application Development**: When establishing test suites for business logic, HTTP routes, or persistence layers.

## Verification Policy

fluo prioritizes **Explicit Verification** over implicit coverage. All platform-facing changes must demonstrate behavioral stability through the following hierarchy:

1.  **Type Safety**: Every public API must be fully typed and pass `pnpm typecheck`.
2.  **Unit Isolation**: Logic-heavy providers must have unit tests with zero external dependencies.
3.  **Module Wiring (Slices)**: Verify that decorators and DI tokens resolve correctly within a `TestingModule`.
4.  **Runtime Parity**: Cross-platform features must pass the `platform-conformance` harness across all supported runtimes (Node.js, Bun, Deno, etc.).

---

## The Testing Toolbox (`@fluojs/testing`)

The `@fluojs/testing` package is the official gateway for all verification activities.

### Core Utilities
- `createTestingModule()`: The primary entry point for module-level integration tests.
- `createTestApp()`: Boots a full application instance for end-to-end (E2E) style verification.
- `TestingModuleRef`: A handle to the compiled test environment for dependency resolution and dispatching.

### Specialized Subpaths
- `@fluojs/testing/mock`: Advanced mocking utilities (`createMock`, `createDeepMock`).
- `@fluojs/testing/http`: Fluent request builders and security principal injectors.
- `@fluojs/testing/platform-conformance`: Standardized test suites for cross-runtime verification.

## Implementation Recipes

### 1. Module Slice with Provider Overrides
Use this when you need real DI wiring but want to fake external collaborators like repositories or third-party clients.

```ts
import { createTestingModule } from '@fluojs/testing';
import { vi } from 'vitest';

const fakeUserRepo = {
  create: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: '1' }),
  findById: vi.fn(),
};

const moduleRef = await createTestingModule({ rootModule: AppModule })
  .overrideProvider(USER_REPOSITORY, fakeUserRepo)
  .compile();

const service = await moduleRef.resolve(UserService);
```

### 2. Guard and Interceptor Verification
Verify request-level policies without booting a full network listener.

```ts
const moduleRef = await createTestingModule({ rootModule: AppModule })
  .overrideGuard(AuthGuard)
  .overrideInterceptor(LoggingInterceptor)
  .compile();
```

### 3. E2E-style HTTP Testing
Use `createTestApp` for high-confidence verification of the entire request lifecycle.

```ts
import { createTestApp } from '@fluojs/testing';

const app = await createTestApp({ rootModule: AppModule });

const response = await app
  .request('GET', '/users/me')
  .principal({ subject: 'user-1', roles: ['member'] })
  .send();

expect(response.status).toBe(200);
await app.close();
```

### 4. Persistence Boundaries (Prisma/Drizzle)
Keep the module wiring real but override the low-level client tokens to avoid network/database coupling in CI.
- Override `PRISMA_CLIENT` for Prisma-based modules.
- Override `DRIZZLE_DATABASE` for Drizzle-based modules.

## Repository Standards

### Commands
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm test` | Runs the full Vitest suite across the workspace. |
| `pnpm verify` | Sequential execution: Build → Typecheck → Lint → Test. |
| `pnpm verify:release-readiness` | Comprehensive read-only gate for public releases, including packed CLI verification. The same verifier also accepts `--target-package`, `--target-version`, and `--dist-tag` for CI-only single-package publish preflight checks. |
| `pnpm generate:release-readiness-drafts` | Explicitly writes release-readiness summary artifacts and the draft changelog block for release prep. |
| `pnpm verify:public-export-tsdoc:baseline` | Runs the public-export TSDoc baseline against the full governed package source surface. |

### CI shutdown-flake attribution

The canonical CI attribution path for the recurring Vitest worker-timeout shutdown flake is opt-in and evidence-only:

- Set `FLUO_VITEST_SHUTDOWN_DEBUG=1` on the `pnpm test`/`pnpm vitest run ...` invocation that you want to inspect.
- Optionally override the output directory with `FLUO_VITEST_SHUTDOWN_DEBUG_DIR`; the default is `.artifacts/vitest-shutdown-debug`.
- The Vitest integration writes current-run JSON evidence when the run ends with unhandled errors or hits `onProcessTimeout`, including the last active module/test and active handle/request class summaries.
- Worker processes also emit a signal-time snapshot so CI can preserve the lingering worker's final file/suite/test context when the main process tears it down.

Treat this path as attribution only: preserve runtime behavior, pool selection, and timeout values until a follow-up issue is targeting a specific leak or teardown contract.

## Release Pre-flight Runbook

Maintainers must ensure verification passes before triggering automated releases.

### 1. Verification Checklist
- [ ] `pnpm verify` passes locally.
- [ ] Public exports follow TSDoc baseline (verified by `pnpm lint`).
- [ ] `pnpm verify:release-readiness` returns no errors for the intended publish surface.

### 2. CI-only Preflight Execution
The manual workflow `.github/workflows/release-single-package.yml` is the canonical publisher for one public package per run. It reuses `pnpm verify:release-readiness` with specific inputs:

```bash
pnpm verify:release-readiness --target-package <package_name> --target-version <version> --dist-tag <tag> --write-summary
```

This gate ensures:
1. The package is within the **intended publish surface**.
2. Its internal `@fluojs/*` dependency ranges are publish-safe (canonical `workspace:^` shape).
3. The version and `dist-tag` are correctly aligned (e.g., no stable release on a `next` tag).

A `release-readiness-summary.md` artifact is generated for each run and attached to the GitHub Release as evidence of preflight success.
