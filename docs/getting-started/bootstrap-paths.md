# Application Bootstrap Protocol

<p><strong><kbd>English</kbd></strong> <a href="./bootstrap-paths.ko.md"><kbd>한국어</kbd></a></p>

## Startup Sequence

1. `FluoFactory.create(rootModule, options)` delegates to `bootstrapApplication(...)` in `packages/runtime/src/bootstrap.ts`.
2. `bootstrapModule(...)` compiles the reachable module graph from the root module and validates imports, exports, provider visibility, and injection metadata.
3. `registerRuntimeBootstrapTokens(...)` registers the selected HTTP adapter under `HTTP_APPLICATION_ADAPTER` and the runtime platform shell under `PLATFORM_SHELL`.
4. `resolveBootstrapLifecycleInstances(...)` resolves runtime providers and module providers that expose lifecycle hooks.
5. `runBootstrapHooks(...)` executes every `onModuleInit()` hook first, then every `onApplicationBootstrap()` hook.
6. `platformShell.start()` runs after lifecycle hooks succeed. Readiness is marked only after that start phase completes.
7. `createRuntimeDispatcher(...)` builds the dispatcher and `bootstrapApplication(...)` returns a `FluoApplication` instance.
8. Network ingress begins when application code later calls `await app.listen()`. Adapter packages implement the runtime specific listen behavior.

## Entry Points

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `examples/minimal/src/main.ts` | Canonical application entry file for the default HTTP bootstrap shape. It creates the application with `FluoFactory.create(...)` and then calls `app.listen()`. |
| `packages/runtime/src/bootstrap.ts` | Source of `bootstrapApplication(...)`, `FluoFactory.create(...)`, `FluoFactory.createApplicationContext(...)`, and `FluoFactory.createMicroservice(...)`. |
| `packages/runtime/src/node.ts` | Public Node specific subpath for raw Node bootstrap helpers and shutdown signal registration helpers. |
| `packages/platform-fastify/src/adapter.ts` | Exposes `createFastifyAdapter(...)`, `bootstrapFastifyApplication(...)`, and `runFastifyApplication(...)` for the Fastify path. |
| `packages/platform-cloudflare-workers/src/adapter.ts` | Exposes `createCloudflareWorkerAdapter(...)`, `bootstrapCloudflareWorkerApplication(...)`, and `createCloudflareWorkerEntrypoint(...)` for the Worker fetch path. |

## Platform Registration

- Application bootstrap accepts the platform binding through the `adapter` option passed to `FluoFactory.create(...)`.
- Runtime bootstrap stores that adapter instance under the `HTTP_APPLICATION_ADAPTER` token and stores the platform shell under `PLATFORM_SHELL`.
- Platform packages live under `@fluojs/platform-*` and provide the adapter factories used at the application boundary, for example `createFastifyAdapter(...)` and `createCloudflareWorkerAdapter(...)`.
- The platform shell starts after lifecycle hooks complete and stops during shutdown cleanup.
- `FluoFactory.createApplicationContext(...)` follows the same module graph and lifecycle path but skips HTTP adapter registration and returns an application context instead of an HTTP application.
- Starter shapes, runtime/platform combinations, and published microservice transport variants are listed in the [fluo new support matrix](../reference/fluo-new-support-matrix.md).

## Shutdown Sequence

1. Shutdown begins when the application closes explicitly or when a host specific helper registers and receives a shutdown signal.
2. `runShutdownHooks(...)` walks lifecycle instances in reverse order.
3. Every `onModuleDestroy()` hook runs before any `onApplicationShutdown(signal)` hook.
4. The platform shell stops through a lifecycle cleanup entry that is appended during bootstrap.
5. Adapter specific `close()` logic drains or rejects ingress according to the runtime contract, for example Fastify waits for server close completion and Cloudflare Workers drains in flight requests before releasing the dispatcher.
6. Container disposal runs after shutdown hooks when bootstrap fails before the application is fully returned.

## Error States

- `ModuleGraphError`: thrown during module graph compilation or validation, including circular imports and invalid imported modules.
- `ModuleVisibilityError`: thrown when a provider, controller, or module export references a token that is not visible from the current module.
- `ModuleInjectionMetadataError`: thrown when constructor injection metadata does not cover required parameters.
- Lifecycle hook failures: any rejection from `onModuleInit()` or `onApplicationBootstrap()` aborts bootstrap before readiness is marked.
- Adapter or platform startup failures: errors thrown while starting the platform shell, creating the dispatcher, or later listening on the adapter surface propagate as bootstrap failures.
- `InvariantError`: thrown by `FluoFactory.createMicroservice(...)` when the resolved runtime token does not implement `listen()`.
- Bootstrap failure cleanup uses the synthetic signal `bootstrap-failed` and runs shutdown hooks plus container disposal before rethrowing the original error.
