# testing guide

Phase 4 locked the official testing baseline, and Phase 5 keeps the public docs aligned with that contract.

## commands

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm verify:release-candidate
```

Generated starter projects expose the same commands through the selected package manager.

## official testing API

`@konekti/testing` currently provides the minimal public testing surface:

- `createTestingModule(...)`
- provider override support
- predictable cleanup through the bootstrap/runtime lifecycle

Primary evidence:

- `packages/testing/src/module.ts`
- `packages/testing/src/module.test.ts`

## runtime and slice coverage

Use these files as the contract examples when expanding tests:

- `packages/module/src/application.test.ts`
- `packages/http/src/dispatcher.test.ts`
- `packages/prisma/src/vertical-slice.test.ts`
- `packages/drizzle/src/vertical-slice.test.ts`

## generated app expectations

`konekti new` emits a starter app with a runnable `src/app.test.ts`. The scaffold integration coverage in `packages/cli/src/cli.test.ts` verifies that a fresh project can run `typecheck`, `build`, `test`, and `konekti g ...` immediately after install, while the generated app test itself proves `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`, and `/openapi.json`.

For the outside-the-monorepo gate, use `pnpm verify:release-candidate`. That command is the current CI-facing public release candidate check, and it relies on the CLI test suite to exercise the packed CLI entrypoint and starter scaffolding that back the documented `@konekti/cli` flow. The command also emits `tooling/release/release-candidate-summary.md` so CI can publish a checklist artifact.
